Welcome to the Big-data and Infectious disease modeling lab (the BI lab), situated within the School of Public Health at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.

The BI Lab is dedicated to researching epidemics and interventions to improve public health outcomes and inform policy. We specialize in applying mathematical modeling, data-driven simulation, machine learning, and optimization methods to study infectious disease transmission and control. Additionally, we use quantitative tools to investigate chronic diseases and other public health challenges.

* I have backgrounds in math, enggineering and public health. I received my Bachelor’s Degree in Applied Mathematics from [Northeastern University (China)](http://english.neu.edu.cn/)， advised by Prof. [Qingling Zhang](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/qlzhang/). I earned my PhD Degree in Industrial Enggineering from [Kansas State University](https://www.k-state.edu/), advised by Prof. [Chih-hang (John) Wu](https://www.imse.ksu.edu/people/faculty/wu/) and Prof. [David Ben-Arieh](https://www.imse.ksu.edu/people/faculty/arieh/).I was a postdoctoral researcher and a theoretical epidemiologist in the [Division of Infectious Diseases & Global Public Health](https://medschool.ucsd.edu/som/medicine/divisions/idgph/Pages/default.aspx) at [ University of California San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), advised by Prof. [Annick Borquez](https://profiles.ucsd.edu/annick.borquez#narrative). My research background includes mathematical modeling, numerical simulation, machine learning and optimization.
* My research interests lie in the general area of infectious disease modeling, particularly in dynamic modeling, cost effectiveness control and qualitative analysis methods to better understand, predict and respond to intersecting epidemics of drug use disorders, overdose, HIV, HCV and other associated health harms; with a focus on social and structural determinants of health. Another interest of my research is the optimal control for the epidemic system, to minimize the total cost due to the infectious and control strategies. Especially for the public health crisis like SARS and COVID-19, and vector-brone diseases like ZIKA Virus and Zoonotic Visceral Leishmaniasis (ZVL).
