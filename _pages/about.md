Welcome to the Big-data and Infectious disease modeling lab (the BI lab), situated within the School of Public Health at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.

The BI Lab is dedicated to researching epidemics and interventions to improve public health outcomes and inform policy. We specialize in applying mathematical modeling, data-driven simulation, machine learning, and optimization methods to study infectious disease transmission and control. Additionally, we use quantitative tools to investigate chronic diseases and other public health challenges.

We are eager to collaborate with researchers across a wide range of topics, spanning both methodology and health applications. The lab is currently seeking self-motivated PhD students with a strong STEM background and a passion for solving real-world public health challenges. Please contact us at: Kaiming.Bi@uth.tmc.edu.
