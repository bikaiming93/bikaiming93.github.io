* I am a postdoctoral researcher and a theoretical epidemiologist in the [Division of Infectious Diseases & Global Public Health (https://medschool.ucsd.edu/som/medicine/divisions/idgph/Pages/default.aspx) at [ University of California San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), advised by Prof. [Annick Borquez](https://profiles.ucsd.edu/annick.borquez#narrative).
* I have backgrounds in math, enggineering and public health. I received my Bachelor’s Degree in Applied Mathematics from [Northeastern University (China)](http://english.neu.edu.cn/)， advised by Prof. [Qingling Zhang](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/qlzhang/). I earned my PhD Degree in Industrial Enggineering from [Kansas State University](https://www.k-state.edu/), advised by Prof. [Chih-hang (John) Wu](https://www.imse.ksu.edu/people/faculty/wu/) and Prof. [David Ben-Arieh](https://www.imse.ksu.edu/people/faculty/arieh/).
* My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in deep learning, reinforcement learning and probabilistic graphical models, as well as their applications in sequential decision making, generative modeling, multi-task and meta-learning and multi-agent systems.
