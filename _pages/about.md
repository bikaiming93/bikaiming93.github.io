* I am a postdoctoral researcher and a theoretical epidemiologist in the [Division of Infectious Diseases & Global Public Health (https://medschool.ucsd.edu/som/medicine/divisions/idgph/Pages/default.aspx) at [ University of California San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), advised by Prof. [Annick Borquez](https://profiles.ucsd.edu/annick.borquez#narrative).
* I have backgrounds in math, enggineering and public health. I received my Bachelor’s Degree in Applied Mathematics from [Northeastern University (China)](http://english.neu.edu.cn/)， advised by Prof. [Qingling Zhang](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/qlzhang/). I earned my PhD Degree in Industrial Enggineering from [Kansas State University](https://www.k-state.edu/), advised by Prof. [Chih-hang (John) Wu](https://www.imse.ksu.edu/people/faculty/wu/) and Prof. [David Ben-Arieh](https://www.imse.ksu.edu/people/faculty/arieh/). My research background includes mathematical modeling, numerical simulation, machine learning and optimization.
* My research interests lie in the general area of infectious disease modeling, particularly in dynamic modeling, cost effectiveness control and qualitative analysis methods to better understand, predict and respond to intersecting epidemics of drug use disorders, overdose, HIV, HCV and other associated health harms; with a focus on social and structural determinants of health. Another interest of my research is the optimal control for the epidemic system, to minimize the total cost due to the infectious and control strategies. Especially for the vector-brone diseases like ZIKA Virus and Zoonotic Visceral Leishmaniasis (ZVL).
