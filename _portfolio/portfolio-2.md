title: "Modeling and theortical analysis for vector-brone disease (KSU)"
location: "Healthcare Operations Resource Center, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, United States"
excerpt: "Vector-borne diseases have more complex transmission routes than the most of infcectious diseases. This research utilizes the dynamic modeling and agent-based modeling to describe the disease transmission for ZIKA Virus and Zoonotic Visceral Leishmaniasis. Theortical analysis are used to figure out the most important part from the model. Based on the analysis result, this research uses optimal control theory to design the control strategies which can reduce the cost during the epidmeic. The simulation is used to verify the control strategies and predict the future disease transmission."
