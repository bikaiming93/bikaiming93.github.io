title: "Real-time prediction of emerging drug use epidemics in the United States (UCSD)"
location: "Division of Infectious Diseases and Global Public Health, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States"
excerpt: "Mathematical modeling has been used extensively to forecast emerging and re- emerging infectious disease epidemics because it allows to mechanistically represent the different factors determining disease transmission and their dynamics over time. We will develop a mathematical model of drug use in the United States which represents current patterns of drug use across the country and associated HIV, HCV and overdose incidence. It will explicitly represent heterogeneity in susceptibility to drug use disorders in the population, social networks and the influence of drug markets, law enforcement and healthcare services on drug use and associated health outcomes. This project will 
1) systematically investigate the potential for emerging drug use epidemics; 
2) identify the optimal allocation of resources towards combination of interventions to control them and limit associated harms;
3) pilot a targeted mass-media based intervention to increase access to appropriate prevention methods among a specific population at risk of an emerging drug use in real time as identified by the model. "
