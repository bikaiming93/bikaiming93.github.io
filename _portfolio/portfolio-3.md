title: "Develop new optimal control algorithm for the epidemic system (KSU)"
location: "Healthcare Operations Resource Center, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, United States"
excerpt: "Since the traditional Pontryagin maximum principle-based optimal control algorithm can only solve the optimal control problem for with convex objective functions. The major contribution of this research is developing the new methodology of numerical epidemic control.An innovative heuristic algorithm based method is proposed to solve the optimal control problem with the highly nonlinear objective function. This project also introduces evidence data based optimal control method, which trained the neural network with epidemic data to control the current prevalence.  "
