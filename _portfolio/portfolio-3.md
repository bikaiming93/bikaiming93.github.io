location: "Healthcare Operations Resource Center, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, United States"
excerpt: "Vector-borne diseases have more complex transmission routes than the most of infcectious diseases. This research utilizes the dynamic modeling and agent-based modeling to describe the disease transmission for ZIKA Virus and Zoonotic Visceral Leishmaniasis. Theortical analysis are used to figure out the most important part from the model. Based on the analysis result, this research uses optimal control theory to design the control strategies which can reduce the cost during the epidmeic. The simulation is used to verify the control strategies and predict the future disease transmission
Since the traditional Pontryagin maximum principle-based optimal control algorithm can only solve the optimal control problem for with convex objective functions. The major contribution of this research is developing the new methodology of numerical epidemic control.An innovative heuristic algorithm based method is proposed to solve the optimal control problem with the highly nonlinear objective function. This project also introduces evidence data based optimal control method, which trained the neural network with epidemic data to control the current prevalence.  "
